# Credit Risk Default Model

This project develops a predictive model for assessing **municipal and corporate credit default risk** using a combination of **principal component analysis (PCA)** and **supervised learning techniques**. The model aims to identify key financial, demographic, and policy variables that explain variations in timely debt repayment and default probability.

## Overview

* Built a **classification framework** to estimate default risk based on factors such as income levels, property values, tax base, delinquency rates, and operating margins.
* Applied **PCA** to reduce dimensionality and extract latent factors capturing macro-financial and socioeconomic trends.
* Trained and compared models including **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forests**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** to evaluate performance across accuracy, AUC, and interpretability.
* Conducted **Monte Carlo simulations** to test scenario robustness under varying economic stress conditions.
